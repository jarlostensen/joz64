UEFI kernel explorations in Zig.
This is me learning about Zig as well as playing around with an UEFI application.

A big thanks goes out to the Ziglang subreddit community and @andrewrk for help and guidance in this learning effort.

You will find some videos of how this project proceeds on https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcMBPIHydEn4i3awhmue_MA/
